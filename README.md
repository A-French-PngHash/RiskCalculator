# RiskCalculator

## Presentation

In Risk - Star Wars, the empire and rebels fight against each other in an effort to gain control of the galaxy. Battles involve different units such as : soldiers, starships (bombers, capital ship...), death star... The issue of the battle is then determined with dice rolls. This tool gives the opportunity for a player to analyse such a battle by displaying the probabilities of an attack wining depending on the number of attacker and defender.

## Structure

There are 2 main components in the program : 
    - The probability calculator (class : `RiskProbabilityCalculator`) which takes in input a configuration of ship as well as the amount of data to generate.
    - The image drawing service, which takes in input data generated by the `RiskProbabilityCalculator` and draws an image displaying the given data.

## Output examples

<img src=Example/1.png width = 400>

In this first example we can see that no side is much stronger than the other, this attack is quite balanced.


<img src=Example/2.pngÂ width = 400>

On the other hand, this second example shows a situation where the attack (thanks to its many ships) completely overruns the defense. At 3 against 7 there is an astonishing **77.9%** win rate for the attack!
