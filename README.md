# RiskCalculator

## Presentation

In Risk - Star Wars, the empire and rebels fight against each other in an effort to gain control of the galaxy. Battles involve different units such as : soldiers, starships (bombers, capital ship...), death star... The issue of the battle is then determined with dice rolls. This tool gives the opportunity for a player to analyse such a battle by displaying the probabilities of an attack wining depending on the number of attaquant and defender.

## Structure

There are 2 main components in the program : 
    - The probability calculator (class : `RiskProbabilityCalculator`) which takes in input a configuration of ship as well as the amount of data to generate.
    - The image drawing service, which takes in input data generated by the `RiskProbabilityCalculator` and draws an image displaying the given data.
