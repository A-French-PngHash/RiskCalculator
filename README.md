# RiskCalculator

## Presentation

In Risk - Star Wars, the empire and rebels fight against each other in an effort to gain control of the galaxy. Battles involve different units such as : soldiers, starships (bombers, capital ship...), death star... The issue of the battle is then determined with dice rolls. This tool gives the opportunity for a player to analyse such a battle by displaying the probabilities of an attack wining depending on the number of attacker and defender.

## Structure

There are 2 main components in the program : 
    - The probability calculator (class : `RiskProbabilityCalculator`) which takes in input a configuration of ship as well as the amount of data to generate.
    - The image drawing service, which takes in input data generated by the `RiskProbabilityCalculator` and draws an image displaying the given data.

## Features & Options

The program asks for:
    - The attacker and defender **ships** : ships change which dice are rolled and how they are read.
    - **Imperial base** on the defender planet : The presence of an imperial base change which dice are rolled by the defender.
    - **Death Star** near the defender planet : A death star is an entity the attacker must defeat before he can hope to destroy defender's soldiers.
    - **Attack Strategy** : how many soldiers the attacker wants to have left after the attack (which means giving up and losing the battle if this amount is reached).
    - **Size** of the table : Inputing through the maximum number of defender and attacker.

## Output examples

In this first example we can see that no side is much stronger than the other, the fight is balanced. Here the attacker stops when he has less than 2 soldiers left.

This second example shows a situation where the attack (thanks to its many ships) completely overruns the defense. At 3 against 7 there is an astonishing **77.9%** win rate for the attack!
